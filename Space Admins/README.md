The SpaceAdmins form is the primary form for system management. The admin has several functions to handle, such as:
1. Calling a client.
2. Setting the polling frequency.
3. Changing the video to be played.
4. Setting the tone during the call (sound effect).
5. Setting the call language (English by default).
6. Data transmission capability to all clients.

I plan to add other features later, as I've prepared the environment for better scalability.
